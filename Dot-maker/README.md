# Dot-Maker

Coding Challenge Rules:

1. Create a react application that allows users to click the screen and leave a dot (10px x 10px)

2. create an "undo" button that allows users to remove the last dot.

- it can be clicked as many times as needed. (until all dots are removed.)

3. create a "redo" button that puts the dots back on the screen.

- it can be clicked as many times as needed. (until all dots are restored.)
